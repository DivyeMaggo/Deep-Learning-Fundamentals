# Perceptron from Scratch

A simple implementation of a perceptron in Python, built from scratch.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a perceptron, a fundamental building block of neural networks. The perceptron is implemented without using any machine learning libraries, providing a clear understanding of its inner workings.

## Features

- Single-layer perceptron implementation
- Configurable learning rate and number of epochs
- Training on user-provided datasets
- Prediction functionality
- Visualization of decision boundary (optional)
